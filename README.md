My curiosity, which began with taking apart devices as a kid, has grown into a deep drive for research and learning. Iâ€™m constantly improving my knowledge and skills, working on innovative solutions for the future of technology while strengthening my teamwork and leadership abilities. I strive to introduce young people to science and aim for big goals like space exploration and humanity becoming a multi-planetary species.
